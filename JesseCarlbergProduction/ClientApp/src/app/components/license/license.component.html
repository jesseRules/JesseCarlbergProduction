      <h2>Photography and Image Usage</h2>
      <p>
        All photographs and images on this site were created by Jesse Carlberg.
        You can use any of the photographs on this site for whatever you want. I
        don't really care, but don't use direct links to my site. I ain't paying
        for your web traffic and will probably change the URL if you do this out
        of spite. If you want to print any of the images just hit me up and I'll
        give you access to the larger files so they print nicer. If you make
        money off my photography, I only ask you spend some of the profits on
        candy.
