              As a senior developer a big part of my job was training new
              developers, analysts, and dev-splaining things to business. Here
              is a few of my blog posts and projects related to this. I also
              strongly believe in "copy-pasting" coding, so you're gonna find a
              lot of my personal favorite snippets and stuff.

              I needed a hobby during the pandemic, so this what I took up. As
              an avid phone-tographer for years before this was a lot of to get
              into. This also extends my capability for building custom
              websites, as I can shoot: headshots, office pictures, etc. I am
              pretty new to the world of photography, but I make up for this by
              taking just a crazy ton of pictures; one of them always turns out
              great.

              OMG, don't make me do this. I'm kidding... mostly, I have been
              asked for this service a lot in the past. However, consulting is
              the hardest thing a developer can do IMO. Every developer wants to
              just trash it all and start over. Keeping the existing
              infrastructure, quirks and all, while fixing production issues is
              an acquired skill. A skill that I am willing to profit off of.

            I've been wanting to build a site like this for a while. A place I
            could just put all my hobbies, all my experience, and all my passion
            into. Being a software developer just means you have more tools to
            solve problems and I find problems every day in my life I want to
            fix. So, this will be that place, my memory palace, my junk drawer
            and that's its reason for being.

              Come marvel at all of past Jesse's work. You can cringe with me at
              my first coding attempts and maybe gain a thing or two from the
              solutions I came up with. I mixed in some of the awards and
              competitions I have been a part of and added a few fun builds to
              keep things light.

              Ugh, everyone has a blog on the internet. And when you hit 30 you
              start a blog or join an MLM to sell crap to your Facebook friends.
              Since none of my friends need glue on fingernail stickers, I'm
              going this route. There's a mix of coding, personal, and
              professional stuff in here and you can sort for what you want to
              read. If you don't find anything you like, try Alt+F4.

            This card is gonna be here for a while. I'm mostly putting this card
            here to remind me to keep at it. That even when this project is
            complete, I still need to use this website/application. That's how I
            learned to code, I was a user and had a problem I needed fixed. So,
            I learned how to code. I learned how to manage servers, get the data
            I needed, and do the things I wanted to do. And even after I
            automated most of my job, built a fancy interface, I found more that
            I could do to make my app better. This is what I am striving for
            here, something I want to use, something that just works.
